1. Problem
   > The Stanford Cell Sciences Imaging Facility (CSIF) faces a significant challenge when it comes to acquiring data from research instruments. Currently, researchers are required to bring their own hard disk drives (HDDs) in order to store and transfer data obtained from the instruments. This dependency on individual HDDs poses several problems. First, it creates logistical difficulties as researchers need to manage and transport their own storage devices, potentially leading to delays and inefficiencies. Moreover, relying on individual HDDs increases the risk of data loss or corruption due to device failure or mishandling. To streamline the data acquisition process and enhance data integrity, it is crucial for the Stanford CSIF to explore alternative solutions that provide a standardized and reliable means of data storage and transfer.
